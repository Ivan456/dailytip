DOM API has a handy  [`Element.scrollIntoView`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView) method which scrolls the element into the viewport.

Although it's supported pretty well among browsers, most of them do not support neither `smooth` option nor timing function, which make the API less useful.
