*tldr; A tip a day. JS & related.*

Hi! My name is James Akwuh and I've started this project to hit a range of professional and personal aims at once (which I will cover as soon as I will reach a number of 100 tips). Until then you are welcome to check out this repo every day for a new tip about JS and related topics. Hope, you will find it helpful.
